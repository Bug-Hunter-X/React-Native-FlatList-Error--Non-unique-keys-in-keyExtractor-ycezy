This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and setting the keyExtractor prop to a function that does not return a unique key for each item.  This results in inconsistent rendering and unexpected behavior.

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={[{id: 1}, {id: 1}, {id: 2}]}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id} // Non-unique keys
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.id}</Text>}
/>
```

The problem is that the `keyExtractor` function returns `1` for two different items, violating the requirement for unique keys. FlatList relies on these keys for efficient rendering and identifying items.
